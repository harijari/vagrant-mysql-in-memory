vagrant-mysql-in-memory
=======================

Simple vagrant profile. It includes only mysql server, where database is stored at ramdisk. 
This virtual machine should implement tweaks listed here http://drupal.org/node/466972.

Hopefully, this should boost significantly simpletest test suite execution.
